						b Lorenzo
						| , originally from Italy, moved to South Carolina while in middle school. After overcoming the challenge of learning a new language in a foreign place, he joined his school's debate team and Youth in Government program to pursue his interest in politics and economics. He discovered his passion for finance and computer science after taking a myriad of online college courses at the height of the MOOCs boom in 2012. After graduating high school last May and advancing his coding skills at a local accellerator, Lorenzo moved to Palo Alto to work on Alpha-Sci full time. He is now being considered for the 2015 Thiel Fellowship.

						b Dan
						|  is a software developer from Indiana. Initially an electrical engineer pursuing a PhD in material science, Dan discovered his true passion lied in software development, and thus embarked in an odyssey that would eventually land him in Greenville, South Carolina. By chance, he met Lorenzo at a local StartUp Weekend conference and they immediately connected over their passion for finance and programming. Dan has also recently become a father, which has brought him great joy and satisfaction. When he is not outputing amazing code or taking care of his wife and daughter, Dan enjoys watching Mad Men.

						| One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.
